# Crawler

* The administrator wanter to know all of the urls of his/her website in order to know what it would look like in the google search engine.
* I created a simple MVC made in vanilla PHP, where anyone can use it in their PHP application or PHP Framework or in their WordPress website by simply adding the entire repository into their root directory and change the DB_NAME in the config.php file.
* I made sure that the app that I made will also work in WordPress without installation or to any PHP web application.
* I just need to display all the urls in his/her homepage for him to see where the guests will actually redirect.



* The first things I need to do is make sure the app works to any PHP web application or any PHP frameworks, even in Wordpress by simply saving the app repository to root directory and redirect to its url repository
* I choose this direction for ease of use.
* Everyone can use it even without reading documentation
